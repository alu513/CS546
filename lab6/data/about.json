  "biography": "I was born in Nashville Tenessee and moved over to Central New Jersey when I was still a baby. I spent my K-12 years in a small rural town called Plainsboro where I went to school in the West Windsor-Plainsboro School District. Supposedly our district was pretty good in terms of education which in my experience was fairly accurate. The schooling was tough and competitive, especially through high school. I spent a lot of time playing Soccer starting at a fairly young age which was not always a fun time with all the hard training that was involved (good thing I don't play anymore). \n Besides that I spent more time than I can remember on my computer which is why I decided to pick up programming in high school by taking the courses that were offered. I actually had very little idea what I was doing at the time, partly because my teacher, partly because it seemed very overwhelming and extrememly different from anything other courses I was taking. But when it came time to choose colleges I couldn't really see myself doing anything else besides Computer Science so here I am at Stevens.",
